# 🎮 Hi there! I'm a Game Developer.

I craft interactive worlds using **Godot** and bring them to life with **Python**.  
Game development for me is all about creativity, storytelling, and technical precision.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python** – for scripting and tool development  
- 🎮 **Godot Engine** – my go-to for 2D/3D game creation  
- 🧠 **GDScript** – Godot's built-in scripting language  
- 🛠️ **VS Code** – my favorite code editor  

---

## 🚀 Currently Working On

- Designing gameplay systems and AI using Godot + Python  
- Building tools to streamline game dev workflows  
- Experimenting with shaders and visual effects  

---

## 📚 Learning & Exploring

- Game architecture and clean code practices  
- Procedural generation techniques  
- Visual scripting and node-based systems in Godot  

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Release an indie title powered by Godot  
- Build reusable systems and tools for rapid prototyping  
- Explore Python-based game logic across genres
